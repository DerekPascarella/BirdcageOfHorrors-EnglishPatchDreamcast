<h2>About the Film Series</h2>
<img width="267" height="200" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/BirdcageOfHorrors-EnglishPatchDreamcast/blob/main/images/player.jpg?raw=true">"Birdcage of Horrors" (グラウエンの鳥籠) is a horror/murder mystery film series produced and published by Sega in association with ASCII Entertainment & Communications. The series was described as an "iDra", or "Internet Drama". It was released between September and July of 1999, taking the form of six multimedia GD-ROM discs. While the format and structure of these discs is not technically <a href="https://segaretro.org/Mil-CD">MiL-CD</a>, they do leverage Sega's own MiL-CD playback software.
<br><br>
The film series was available through the <a href="https://segaretro.org/Sega_Direct">Dreamcast Direct</a> online service and was uniquely presented in 365 one-minute episodes across each of the six discs. Each episode became accessible gradually over a year, from October 1st, 1999 to October 1st, 2000. Originally, viewers had to connect their Dreamcast to the internet daily and download special save files to their VMU to unlock new episodes. Additionally, each entry of "Grauen no Torikago" was only available to those who completed the previous chapters.
<br><br>
Additionally, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000817025240/http://www.e-sekai.com/grauen/">dedicated "Birdcage of Horrors" website</a> was hosted by ASCII Entertainment & Communications where viewers could stream the series using Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or QuickTime Player on their PC or Mac.
<br><br>
Shortly after the final episode was released, the servers went offline. While there does exist a special VMU save file that allows viewers to watch the content on all six GD-ROMs, this English translation patch removes this requirement. Instead, all six discs function as standalone pieces of software.

<h2>Playback Controls</h2>
<img width="267" height="200" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/BirdcageOfHorrors-EnglishPatchDreamcast/blob/main/images/controls.jpg?raw=true">Controlling playback of the film series is done via standard Dreamcast controller. No other input peripherals, such as mouse or keyboard, are supported.
